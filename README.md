# AlgMethods_QRDecomp
**Algebraic Methods in DS - QR Decomposition implementation:**
This is my Python implementation of the QR Decomposition process of a (real) matrix `A`, using the Numpy library. It also includes an implementation of the Gramâ€“Schmidt process of a set of vectors into an orthogonal set.

More info can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition).
